# Acorn for a Spring Boot sample app - Petclinic App

This is the popular [Petclinic App](https://github.com/spring-petclinic) built using Spring Boot. The Spring PetClinic is an open source sample application developed to demonstrate the database-oriented capabilities of Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and the Spring Data Framework. Itâ€™s based on this Spring stack and built with Maven. The Spring Petclinic `main` branch in the main `spring-projects` GitHub org is the "canonical" implementation, currently based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. We have used one of the [several forks](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html) hosted a special GitHub org: [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic)

In this sample Application the pet owner can register themselves, add their pets and plan visits with the Vets.

## What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is a project that is built on the top of the Spring Framework. It provides an easier and faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple and web-based applications. It is a Spring module that provides the RAD (Rapid Application Development) feature to the Spring Framework. It is used to create a stand-alone Spring-based application that you can just run because it needs minimal Spring configuration.
